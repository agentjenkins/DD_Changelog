# DD_Changelog
## 26/10/2018
### Changelog feature available in the dashboard
Starting from today, all new features will be announced using this channel also.
- Major features (features which might impact users' way of using Dashboard) will be announced here and additional details will reach superusers before the deployment;
- Minor features (features which might *NOT* impact users' way of working) will be described here.

### Toggled Features
The dashbaord is now able to toggle features on and off accordingly to the deployment/integration status of the market. 
This means that not all the features described in the changelog will be available in all markets yet.
Toggled features will be highlighted in their title.

### Maintenance protocol for Flexible maintenance (Toggled Feature)
The maintenance protocol for Flexible maintenance has been added to the maintenance widget;
- In the widget, a new section called "*download*" is available;
- A "*PDF*" button allows the user to download the document;
- The protocol is available in the same language of the user's dashbaord;
- Additional information on the protocol will be added in the next update.
